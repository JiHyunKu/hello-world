First time doing this. I am a college student with not so ordinary path. 

First I graduated from community college.
Then I graduated from liberal arts college.
Now I am at one of the ivy leagues, starting my educational career once again.

I am here because of my loving family, and I wish to continue striving for the highest. After all, this only the beginning.

... also I love sleep.
